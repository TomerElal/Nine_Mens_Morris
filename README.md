# Nine Men's Morris

## Introduction

Welcome to Nine Men's Morris, a classic strategy board game that dates back to the Roman Empire. This game is designed for two players who aim to form 'mills' - a line of three of their own pieces. Itâ€™s a game of strategy and tactical skill.

## Game Rules

### Objective

The objective of the game is to reduce your opponent to two pieces or block all their possible moves.

### Setup

- Each player starts with nine pieces.
- The board consists of three concentric squares connected by lines at the midpoints of their sides.

### Phases of the Game

1. **Placing Pieces Phase**: Players take turns placing their pieces on any empty spot on the board.
2. **Moving Pieces Phase**: Once all pieces are placed, players take turns moving their pieces to adjacent spots.
3. **Flying Phase**: When a player is reduced to three pieces, they can 'fly', meaning they can move their pieces to any empty spot on the board.

### Forming a Mill

A 'mill' is formed when three of a player's pieces are aligned in a straight line along the board's connections. Forming a mill allows the player to remove one of the opponent's pieces from the board, except those in a mill unless no other pieces are available.

### Winning the Game

The game is won by reducing the opponent to two pieces or by blocking all the opponent's moves.
